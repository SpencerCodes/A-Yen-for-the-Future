## Report:

During this analysis I conducted 4 predictive models;

-ARMA, ARIMA, GARCH, and Liner Regression.

The ARMA model predicted negative returns from CAD/JPY
The ARIMA model predicted a lowering the the exchange rate of CAD/JPY
GARCH pridicted an increase in volatility

The linear regression was better at fitting out of sample data
